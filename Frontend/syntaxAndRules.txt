Thank you for using this <unnamed> NoSQL database v0.1, with the <unnamed> Language. We define here the rules of the language. We have tried to make it as user friendly as possible, and if you think something needs to be changed, please feel free to access our source code at http://github.com/karthiksbhat/Mini-NoSQL-Database and contribute to it.

Simple Rules
1. No commas. Period.

Syntax
1. Insert

	Syntax

	If this is the first insertion to a collection, there will be a prompt asking for the primary keys to be specified.
